# Notes

**Variable** in Java is a data container that stores the data values

3 types of java variables

1. Local Variables: These are declared inside a method.
2. Instance Variables: These are defined without the "STATIC" keyword, outside of any method. They belong to each individual object.
3. Static Variables: These are initialized only once when the program starts. They need to be initialized before any instance variables.

**Data types** in Java are labels (specifiers) that tell us what kind of information a variable can hold. They specify the size and type of values that can be stored in a variable.

two types of data types in java

1. Primitive Data Type

   - boolean
   - char
   - byte
   - short
   - int
   - long
   - float
   - double

2. Non-primitive Data Type

   - Classes
   - Interfaces
   - Arrays

| Data Type | Default Value | Default Size |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| boolean   | false         | 1 bit        |
| char      | '\u0000'      | 2 byte       |
| byte      | 0             | 1 byte       |
| short     | 0             | 2 byte       |
| int       | 0             | 4 byte       |
| long      | 0L            | 8 byte       |
| float     | 0.0f          | 4 byte       |
| double    | 0.0d          | 8 byte       |

Type Conversion (Implicit Conversion) - Type conversion, or implicit conversion, happens automatically in Java when data of one type is assigned to another compatible type.

Type Casting (Explicit Conversion) - Type casting, or explicit conversion, is when you manually convert data from one type to another.

**Conditionals**
Java has the following conditional statements:

- Use **if** to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use **else** to specify a block of code to be executed if the same condition is false
- Use **else if** to specify a new condition to test; if the first condition is false
- Use **switch** to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
- Use **?,:** operator to specify one line condition

**Functions**

A method/function is a way to perform some task. Similarly, in programming like Java, a function method is a block of code written to perform a specific task repeatedly. It provides reusability of code. We
