# Notes

**Variable** in Java is a data container that stores the data values

3 types of java variables

1. Local Variables: These are declared inside a method.
2. Instance Variables: These are defined without the "STATIC" keyword, outside of any method. They belong to each individual object.
3. Static Variables: These are initialized only once when the program starts. They need to be initialized before any instance variables.
